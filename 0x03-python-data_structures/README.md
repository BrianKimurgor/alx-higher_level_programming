Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples - README
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and a C program focusing on lists and tuples in Python. The various scripts demonstrate practical uses and manipulation of these data structures. The main files included are as follows:

Execute 12-switch.py using chmod u+x 12-switch.py for the checker to successfully check.

Table of Contents
0-print_list_integer.py: Python function to print all integers in a list.
1-element_at.py: Python function to retrieve an element from a list, similar to accessing elements in C.
2-replace_in_list.py: Python function to replace an element in a list at a specific position, similar to C.
3-print_reversed_list_integer.py: Python function to print integers of a list in reverse order.
4-new_in_list.py: Python function to replace an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list, like C.
5-no_c.py: Python function to remove all occurrences of characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
6-print_matrix_integer.py: Python function to print a matrix of integers.
7-add_tuple.py: Python function to add two tuples.
8-multiple_returns.py: Python function to return a tuple containing the length of a string and its first character.
9-max_integer.py: Python function to find the largest integer in a list.
10-divisible_by_2.py: Python function to find all multiples of 2 in a list.
11-delete_at.py: Python function to delete an item at a specific position in a list.
12-switch.py: Python program to complete source code and switch the values of variables 'a' and 'b'.
13-is_palindrome.c: C program to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
lists.h: Header file for the C program.
100-print_python_list_info.c: C function to compile in a shared library that provides information about a Python list.
100-test_lists.py: Python script to test the C function mentioned above.
Usage
Each script or program is intended to demonstrate specific operations related to lists and tuples in Python, and in some cases, their counterparts in the C programming language. Detailed explanations are provided within each file to clarify the purpose and usage of the code. Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these examples to enhance your understanding of these data structures in Python and C.
