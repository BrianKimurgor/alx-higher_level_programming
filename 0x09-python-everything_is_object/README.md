Welcome to the world of Python, where everything is an object! This project will take you on a journey to explore the fascinating world of Python objects and how they work.

## What's Inside?

In this project, we'll dive into various aspects of Python objects:

- Object instantiation: How objects are created.
- Variable aliasing: Understanding different names for the same object.
- Object identifiers: Exploring memory addresses in Python (CPython).
- Object types: Identifying the types of objects.
- Object mutability: Discovering if objects can change.

## Tasks and Challenges

We've prepared a series of tasks and quiz-like challenges to deepen your understanding of Python objects. Each task is like a puzzle that will help you grasp important concepts. Don't worry; we'll guide you through it!

## Testing Your Knowledge

We have a set of tests to ensure you've mastered each concept. Think of them as your checkpoints to see how well you've learned. You can find the test files in the "tests" folder.

## Ready to Get Started?

Python is a powerful and versatile language, and understanding how everything is an object is a key step in becoming a Python pro. Let's embark on this journey together, and remember, there's always more to learn and discover in the world of Python! üêçüåü
