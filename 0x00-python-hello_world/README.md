# Python - Hello, World

This directory serves as a fundamental introduction to the Python programming language.

**Note:** During the completion of this project, please follow these steps to ensure proper execution:

1. Use a text editor of your preference to create and access the file in insert mode.
2. Make sure the very first line of all your files reads: `#!/bin/bash`.
3. The second line should contain the accurate command/answer.

(From your terminal, convert the created file into a script using the command `chmod u+x filename`. Neglecting this step will result in the last checks for tasks 0 and task 1 failing to execute.)
