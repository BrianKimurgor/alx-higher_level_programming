Python - Import & Modules
This project explores the concepts of importing functions and creating modules in Python. It also involves using the built-in dir() function and handling command line arguments within Python programs.

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
0. Import a simple function from a simple file

0-add.py: This Python program imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3. The output format is <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed by a newline.

1. My first toolbox!

1-calculation.py: In this Python program, functions are imported from the file calculator_1.py, and the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 10 and 5 are printed. The output format is <a value> <operator> <b value> = <operation(a, b) value> followed by a newline.

2. How to make a script dynamic!

2-args.py: This Python program prints the number of arguments and the list of arguments provided. The output format is [Number of arguments] argument(s), followed by : (or . if no arguments were passed), and then one argument per line with the position and value.

3. Infinite addition

3-infinite_add.py: In this Python program, the result of adding all the provided arguments is printed. The output is the sum of the arguments followed by a newline.

4. Who are you?

4-hidden_discovery.py: This Python program prints the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc. The names are displayed alphabetically, with those starting with __ omitted.

5. Everything can be imported

5-variable_load.py: In this Python program, the variable a is imported from the file variable_load_5.py, and its value is printed.

6. Build my own calculator!

100-my_calculator.py: This Python program imports functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations based on command line arguments. The program accepts an operator and two operands, performs the specified operation, and prints the result. If the operator is not recognized or the number of arguments is incorrect, error messages are printed.

7. Easy print

101-easy_print.py: This Python program prints #pythoniscool followed by a newline to the standard output. It achieves this without using print, eval, open, or sys.

8. ByteCode -> Python #3

102-magic_calculation.py: This Python function is designed to match a specific bytecode provided by Holberton School.

9. Fast alphabet

103-fast_alphabet.py: This Python program prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a newline. It accomplishes this without using loops, conditionals, str.join(), string literals, or system calls.
